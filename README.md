** 👋 Hi there! I'm Paige! **

I'm a self-taught web developer with a deep love for design and programming. I truly love crafting beautiful websites that not only look great but also provide unique user experience. My journey has led me to explore various technologies and frameworks.

🤍 Based in Melbourne, AU
💻 Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
🎨 Design: UI/UX Design, Adobe Suite, Figma

🌱 Currently Learning:
- React
- Vue.js
- Improving my design skills

In my spare time
🏃🏼‍♀️‍➡️ You'll either find me being active and exploring nature 
🍛 Cooking up a delicious meal in the kitchen, or
💻 Hard at work learning new design skills, and programming languages (I'm looking at you Python!)
